# Contrastive VAE

Python code for learning salient latent features with contrastive variational autoencoders. This code is useful when one is interested in patterns or latent variables that exist one dataset, but not the other. Applications include dicovering subgroups in biological and medical data. 

See the original paper, titled "Contrastive Variational Autoencoder Enhances Salient Features" by Abubakar Abid and James Zou, which is available on ArXiv.

This repository also includes experiments to reproduce most of the figures in the paper. Please see the python notebooks in the experiments folder.
